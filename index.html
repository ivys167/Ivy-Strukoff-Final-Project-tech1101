                    <p>I am a 19 year old college student (at the time of writing this) from Calgary, Canada. I am currently in the software development program in Bow Valley College. I have had an interest in coding for a while, however I'm still quite new to it. I hope to build the skills necessary to go into this field professionally.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies and interests</h2>
                    <p>I have built up many hobbies over the years, most of them are creativity related.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="hobbieslist">
                    <p>My hobbies include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Coding</strong> - I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, Java, and Python. Although I am mostly proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C++. I want to try to specialize in object oriented programming in the future.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drawing</strong> - I make mostly digital art using procreate. I have also done a couple of art commisions for some friends of mine. Some examples of my art can be found further down the page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Producing Music</strong> - I have been creating my own music since 2016. I use garageband to make music and I mostly make EDM (Electronic Dance Music). You can listen to my music on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/crunchy_munchy">my Soundcloud page.</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - I mostly make album covers for my own music projects. I have also made some album artwork for other music producers as well. You can find some examples further down the page.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="interestslist">
                    <p>There are also some other interests I want to pursue in the future:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>3D Modelling</strong> - I have wanted to further pursue creating visuals for a while. I feel as if 3d modelling would be a good skill for me to pick up in the future as it would also help me with the next skill I want to learn in the future.</li>
                        <li><strong>Game Development</strong> - I have had a little bit of experience making games, however it was a long time ago. I have been interested in learning how to make my own video games for a while.</li>
